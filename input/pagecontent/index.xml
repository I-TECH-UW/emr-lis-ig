    This is the FHIR Implementation Guide for Laboratory Workflows between health information systems based on 
    <a href="https://guides.ohie.org/arch-spec/introduction/laboratory-work-flows">
      OpenHIE Specifications for Laboratory Workflows
    </a>. 
  </p>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <a name="summary"> </a>
  <p>
    This Implementation Guide contains standards-compliant, open specifications for the transmission of Laboratory data between various 
    health systems that are part of a Health Information Exchange (HIE). The contained specifications cover, for example, the following scenario:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>A Lab Test Order is made using an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system</li>
    <li>The order is sent to a Lab Information System (LIS)</li>
    <li>The Lab Test is performed and resulted</li>
    <li>The results are sent back to the EMR for review by the medical team and patients</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    This IG is based on guidance from the FHIR documentation on the <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/workflow-module.html">Workflow Module</a>
    and specifically the suggested <a href="https://hl7.org/fhir/workflow-communications.html">Communication Patterns</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>About this IG</h3>

  <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
  <p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as
    public domain, this guide includes examples making use of terminologies such
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing
    requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing
    and any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other
    components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases,
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using
    certain questionnaires may be shared with.
